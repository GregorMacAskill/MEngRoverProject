## Dependencies and Compatibility
The code within this repository is intended to be used with the M5StickC/M5StickC PLUS and RoverC/RoverC Pro. As such, it relies on the "M5StickC"/"M5StickCPlus" and "M5-RoverC" libraries by M5Stack being installed. These libraries can be downloaded from M5Stack directly or via the Arduino IDE.
If the user wishes to utilise remote control of the rover using a PS3 controller via bluetooth, then
